## 🎨 Theme Philosophy

Our themes are designed with these principles:

1. **Accessibility First** - All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards
2. **Semantic Consistency** - Same token types use consistent colors across platforms
3. **Brand Identity** - Incorporates Sentry's distinctive purple and pink palette
4. **Developer Comfort** - Optimized for long coding sessions
